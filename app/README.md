# Movie Quiz App

## Introduction
The Movie Quiz App is an engaging Android application that challenges users with questions about movies and their directors. The app draws from a rich database of IMDB's top 250 movies, leveraging a public API to provide up-to-date information on these films.

## How It Works
Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a welcoming screen before navigating to the main page. Here, users can choose to play the quiz or view their statistics. The quiz presents a series of questions, each with four possible answers, where users must select the correct director for the given movie. After making a selection, users can proceed to the next question by shaking their device, taking advantage of the smartphone's accelerometer sensor. The app keeps track of users' scores, providing a ratio of correct to incorrect answers in the statistics page.

## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for the app development.
- **Android SDK**: Provides the tools and APIs necessary to develop apps on Android.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native UIs.
- **Material Theming**: Utilized to create a cohesive design, including a custom color palette that supports a dark theme, and custom fonts that enhance the user experience.
- **Accelerometer Sensor**: Integrates physical device movement to trigger navigation to the next quiz question.

## Objectives Satisfied
- **Public API Consumption**: The app uses public domain image from web.
- **Material Theming**: A custom color palette and typography have been designed to provide a unique and consistent look and feel across the app, with support for a dark theme.
- **Hardware Feature Utilization**: The accelerometer sensor is used to add interactive navigation within the app, allowing users to shake their device to proceed to the next question.
